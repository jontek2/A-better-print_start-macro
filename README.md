# A better print_start macro

**:warning: This is still in BETA :warning:**

This document aims to help you get a better, simpler and more powerful print_start macro for your Voron printer. With this macro you will be able to pass variables such as print temps and chamber temps to your print_start macro. By doing so you will be able to automatically start a heatsoak and customize your printer's behaviour. The heatsoak will start when you've sliced a print with a bed temp higher than 90c. It will then heatsoak to your set chamber temp. If no chamber temp is set it will fall back to the macro's standard chamber temp of 40c. 

Each command has a comment next to it explaining what it does. Make sure to read through the macro and get an understanding of what it does.

In short this macro will perform:

1) Home the printer
2) Heatsoak if neccesary
3) QGL/Z-tilt adjust
4) Bed mesh (if activated)
5) Make a short purge/prime line
6) Start the print

## Requirements

### For V2/Trident

 Just like you did in printer.cfg you will need to go through and uncomment parts of the macro in order to make it work with your printer:

 - Bed mesh (2 lines at 2 locations)
 - Screw_tilt_adjust if your printer is a Trident
 - Quad gantry level if your printer is a V2
 - [Nevermore](https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro) - if you have one

 Other requirements:

  - [Stealthburner](https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner)
  - Chamber thermistor

### For v0

 Just like you did in printer.cfg you will need to go through and uncomment parts of the macro in order to make it work with your printer:

 - [Nevermore](https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro) - if you have one

Other requirements:
  - Chamber thermistor

## :warning: Required change in your slicer :warning:
You need to update your "Start g-code" in your slicer by adding a few lines of code. This will send data about your print temps and chamber temp to klipper for each print.

### SuperSlicer
In Superslicer go to "Printer settings" -> "Custom g-code" -> "Start G-code" and update it to:

```
M104 S0 ; Stops SuperSlicer from sending temp waits separately
M140 S0
print_start EXTRUDER=[first_layer_temperature] BED=[first_layer_bed_temperature] CHAMBER=[chamber_temperature]
```

### PrusaSlicer

:warning: PrusaSlicer doesn't give you the option to set a specific chambertemp. Therefor you it will fallback to the standard chambertemp of 40c. 

In PrusaSlicer go to "Printer settings" -> "Custom g-code" -> "Start G-code" and update it to:

```
M104 S0 ; Stops PrusaSlicer from sending temp waits separately
M140 S0
print_start EXTRUDER=[first_layer_temperature[initial_extruder]] BED=[first_layer_bed_temperature]
```

### Cura

In Cura go to "Settings" -> "Printer" -> "Manage printers" -> "Machine settings" -> "Start G-code" and update it to:

```
print_start EXTRUDER={material_print_temperature_layer_0} BED={material_bed_temperature_layer_0} CHAMBER={build_volume_temperature}
```

## :warning: Required verification/changes in your printer.cfg :warning:

The print_start macro has predefined names for nevermore and chamber thermistor. Therefor you need to make sure that your's are named correctly.

In your printer.cfg file verify the following:

**Chamber thermistor**:
Make sure that chamber thermistor is named "chamber".

```
[temperature_sensor chamber]
sensor_type:  XXX
sensor_pin:   XXX
```

**Nevermore**:
Make sure that nevermore is named "nevermore".

```
[output_pin nevermore]
pin: XXX
value: 0
shutdown_value: 0
```

With this macro you have the option to turn the nevermore ON. This means that if you uncomment the logic for the nevermore it will be ON until you turn it off. It's recommended to add logic to your print_end macro and turning the nevermore OFF. This can be done by adding ```SET_PIN PIN=nevermore VALUE=0``` to your print_end macro.


# The print_start macro for V2/Trident

As mentioned above you will need to uncomment parts of this macro for it to work on your V2 or Trident. Replace this macro with your current print_start macro in your printer.cfg.
